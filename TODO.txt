Sian questions:

* How come .first and .second work as methods, in the print_weeks_and_days method?

-> because require_relative('./pair') in letter.rb brings in Pair functions
   (see pair.rb, in particular the methods first and second are defined
    on line 3 using:   attr_reader :first, :second)
