To do:

* Input: "Hey you" - missing week number
    Week 14: Sun, 
    Week 15: 
    Week 17: 
    Week 18: Sun, 

* Remove comma on last day of the week

* Check input for unsupported characters e.g.'&' 
  (looking it up in LETTERS returns nil)
   What's your tag?
   guns&roses
   <error/crash>

 * Website with check box select


Sian questions:

* How come .first and .second work as methods, in the print_weeks_and_days method?

-> because require_relative('./pair') in letter.rb brings in Pair functions
   (see pair.rb, in particular the methods first and second are defined
    on line 3 using:   attr_reader :first, :second)
